# Wireless-Notice-Board
This project implements a Bluetooth-Based Wireless Notice Board System that enables wireless transmission and real-time display of messages on an LCD. Messages are sent from a mobile device or computer via a Bluetooth module to a microcontroller-based system (LPC21xx), which processes the received data and updates the display instantly.
